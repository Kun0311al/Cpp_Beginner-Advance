                             derive containers->real world modeling ex:stack,queue,priority queue*/
/*vector: randon access(fast),middle incertion/detetion(slow),insertion at end(fast)
list: randon access(slow),middle incertion/detetion(fast),insertion at end(fast)*/
/*associative containers: all operations fast except random access*/
/*derived : all operations depends */
